ALKYL_FLUOR_STEP4_TEXT = '''Under nitrogen atmosphere, potassium fluoride (380 mg, 6.45 mmol, 3.00 equiv.), potassium tetrafluoroborate (1.35 g, 10.75 mmol, 5.00 equiv.) and 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2- chloroimidazolium chloride (1) (1.00 g, 2.15 mmol, 1.00 equiv.) were added to a 25 mL pressure flask and dried for 2 hours. The solids were then suspended in 18 mL acetonitrile. The mixture was heated at 80 °C for 16 hours with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, then filtered through a pad of Celite, eluting with dichloromethane (3 × 15 mL). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo, after which the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (30 mL) and filtered again through Celite, eluting with dichloromethane (3 × 15 mL). It was then concentrated in vacuo and the residual solid was washed with diethyl ether (3 × 15 mL) to afford the title compound as a colorless solid.'''
