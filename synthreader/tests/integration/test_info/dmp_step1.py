DMP_STEP1_TEXT = '''2-Iodobenzoic acid (50.0 g, 0.20 mol) was added all at once to a solution
of Oxone (181.0 g, 0.29 mol, 1.3 equiv) in deionized water (650 mL, 0.45 M)
in a 2 L flask with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was warmed to 70−73 °C over 20 min and
mechanically stirred at this temperature for 3 h. The aspect of the mixture
varies consistently during the reaction. The initial thick slurry coating
the walls of the flask eventually becomes a finely dispersed, easy to stir
suspension of a small amount of solid that sedimented easily upon stopping
the stirring. The suspension was then cooled to 5 °C and left at this
temperature for 1.5 h with slow stirring. The mixture was filtered through a
medium porosity sintered-glass funnel, and the solid was repeatedly rinsed
with water (6 × 100 mL) and acetone (2 × 100 mL). The white, crystalline
solid was left to dry at rt for 2 hr.'''
