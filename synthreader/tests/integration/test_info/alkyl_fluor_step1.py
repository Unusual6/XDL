ALKYL_FLUOR_STEP1_TEXT = '''In air, to a solution of 2,6-diisopropylaniline (197 g, 1.00 mol, 2.00 equiv) and HOAc (1.0 mL, 0.018 mol, 0.035 equiv) in 250 mL of MeOH at 50°C in a flask was added a solution of glyoxal (73 g, 0.50 mol, 1.0 equiv) in 250 mL of MeOH. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50°C for 15 min and then stirred at 23°C for 10 h. The reaction mixture was filtered. The filter cake was washed with MeOH (3 x 100 mL) and dried in vacuo to afford 169 g of compound S1 as a yellow solid (90% yield) -->'''
