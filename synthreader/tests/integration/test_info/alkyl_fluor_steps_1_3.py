ALKYL_FLUOR_STEPS_1_3_TEXT = '''In air, to a solution of 2,6-diisopropylaniline (197 g, 1.00 mol, 2.00 equiv) and HOAc (1.0 mL, 0.018 mol, 0.035 equiv) in 250 mL of MeOH at 50°C in a flask was added a solution of glyoxal (73 g, 0.50 mol, 1.0 equiv) in 250 mL of MeOH. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50°C for 15 min and then stirred at 23°C for 10 h. The reaction mixture was filtered. The filter cake was washed with MeOH (3 x 100 mL) and dried in vacuo to afford 169 g of compound S1 as a yellow solid (90% yield).

In air, to N,N'-1,4-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-1,4-diaza-butadiene (S1) (226 g, 0.600 mol, 1.00 equiv) and paraformaldehyde (18.1 g, 0.603 mol, 1.03 equiv) was added 5.4 L of EtOAc at 70°C. A solution of TMSCl (76.5 mL, 0.603 mol, 1.03 equiv) in 80 mL of EtOAc was then added at 70°C, dropwise, over 45 min, with vigorous stirring.  The reaction mixture was stirred at 70°C for 2 h. After cooling to 10°C with stirring, the reaction mixture was filtered.  The filter cake was washed with EtOAc (3 x 500 mL) and dried in vacuo to afford 220 g of compound S2 as a colorless solid (86% yield).

To N,N'-1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium chloride(S2) (150 g, 353 mmol, 1.00 equiv) was added 700 mL of THF and a solution of KOtBu (47.4 g, 423 mmol, 1.20 equiv) in 423 mL of THF at 23°C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 23°C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to -40°C and 1M 1,1,1,2,2,2-hexachloroethane solution (423 mL, 1.20 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was warmed to 23°C and stirred at this temperature for 24 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to -40°C  and filtered. The filter cake was washed with THF (3 x 100 mL) and toluene (6 x 100 mL) at -40°C. It was then dissolved in CH2Cl2 (500 mL) at room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite (10 g) eluting with CH2Cl2 (3 x 50 mL). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 131 g of compound S3 as a colorless solid (81% yield).
