ALKYL_FLUOR_STEP3_TEXT = '''To N,N'-1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium chloride(S2) (150 g, 353 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in 700 mL of THF in a flask at 23°C was added KOtBu (47.4 g, 423 mmol, 1.20 equiv). The reaction mixture was stirred at 23°C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to -40°C and 1M 1,1,1,2,2,2-hexachloroethane solution (423 mL, 1.20 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was warmed to 23°C and stirred at this temperature for 24 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to -40°C  and filtered. The filter cake was washed with THF (3 x 100 mL) and toluene (6 x 100 mL) at -40°C. It was then dissolved in CH2Cl2 (500 mL) at room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite (10 g) eluting with CH2Cl2 (3 x 50 mL). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 131 g of compound S3 as a colorless solid (81% yield).'''
