class Parallelizer(object):
    """ Module for Parallel processing of XDL scripts.

    By specifying a list of XDL scripts and available hardware, the
    parallelizer automatically determines:

        i)  the optimal allocation of XDL steps to hardware resources.
        ii) the appropriate execution sequence for those steps.

    Resource Allocation
    -------------------

    1. For each XDL block supplied, all of the ways in which this block
        can be executed on the available harware are determined, and a
        corresponding XDL object is initialized for each of these.
        E.g. if two reactors are available but the XDL block calls for one,
        two XDL objects are generated - one for the use of each reactor.

    2. All possible combinations of these XDL objects are generated,
        selecting one XDL object per XDL block supplied. For each
        combination, the best possible resource allocation is derermined.

    3. The XDL object combination that produces the shortest execution
        time is chosen and passed on for execution.

    Execution
    ---------

    With the optimal XDL object combinaton, an execution stream is
    compiled, which consists of a list of steps that are to be
    executed at each time interval. At each time interval, all steps
    present are executed asynchronously, with hardware locked by the
    Chempiler before execution, and unlocked after.

    If a given step requests a hardware component that is locked by
    a step from a previous time interval, the step is delayed until
    the hardware component becomes available.
