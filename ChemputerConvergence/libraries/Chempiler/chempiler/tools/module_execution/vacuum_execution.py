        Starts an automatic determination of the boiling vacuum

        Short manual:
        ------------
        The automatic mode works correct and quite reliable for simple solvent
        mixtures and will make your evaporation routine easier. However,
        it is not ideal, especially if set up incorrectly. Below is the quick
        manual:

        1) Select the proper sensitivity mode for your mixture:
            - HIGH (auto_mode=2, Default) is generally recommended for small
                solvent quantities and will lead to longer process time
            - NORMAL (auto_mode=1) is what it says - "normal"
            - LOW (auto_mode=0) is used for "uncritical" processes to reduce
                process time
        2) Choose the appropriate minimum vacuum point, it might set to:
            - Specific value in mbar (vacuum_limit=value) and must be chosen
                with respect to your solvent boiling point at room temperature,
                otherwiseyou will face the situation when he solvent will start
                to evaporate from the collecting flask and the process will
                never finish.
            - OFF (with vacuum_limit=0) however this will definitely lead to the
                situation described above.
            - AUTO (vacuum_limit=1) - to relay on the Vacuubrand algorithms for
                the automatic end point determination, however it is only
                recommended for large amount of solvent.
        3) Set the duration limit to prevent evaporation process
        from running forever. By default it is set to 3 hours which should be
        sufficient to evaporate anything on the current Chemputer scale.
        4) If you don't want to vent you system through vacuum pump (i.e. you
           need to maintain inert athmospere) you may select not to do it with
           vent_after set to False

            node_name (str): The name of the vacuum pump
            auto_mode (int): Sensitivity parameter for the automatic boiling
                point determination; possible values - 0: "HIGH"; 1: "NORMAL";
