The current Cronin conductivity sensor measures solution conductivity against
a pair of resistors. The measured conductivities can then be reported back as
a tuple of 10-bit integers by sending the string `C` to the sensor. Alternatively, the
sensor can add up any measured conductivities and report them back as a single large
integer if the string `Q` is sent. This is useful for backwards compatibility as well
as the fact that a large change in conductivity against any single resistance is
typically indicative of a phase change.
